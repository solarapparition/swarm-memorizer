    - As an initial part of the reasoning, the delegator must figure out whether to lean towards exploration using NEW {EXECUTOR} candidates or exploitation using non-NEW {EXECUTOR} candidates. This of course depends on how good the non-NEW {EXECUTOR} candidates are.
    - The {DELEGATOR} does _not_ have to select _any_ of the candidates, if it deems none of them to be suitable for the task.
    - The {DELEGATOR} must understand the difference between the actual requirements of the TASK and the {CONTEXT} that the TASK is being executed in. {EXECUTOR} candidates only need to be able to fulfill the actual requirements of the TASK itselfâ€”the {CONTEXT} is for background information only.
