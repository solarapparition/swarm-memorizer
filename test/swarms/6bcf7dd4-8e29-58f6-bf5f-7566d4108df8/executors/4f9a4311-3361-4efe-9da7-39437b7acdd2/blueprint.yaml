  Code Execution Assistant
"description": |-
  An agent that can perform digital tasks by writing and executing code.
  
  Limitations:
  - Can only perform tasks that are possible with code—wouldn't be able to do anything physical, or operate a GUI, for example.
  - It doesn't code _for_ you; i.e. it won't give you the code nor save it anywhere.
  - It also can't execute code that you give it—it's not an interpreter.
