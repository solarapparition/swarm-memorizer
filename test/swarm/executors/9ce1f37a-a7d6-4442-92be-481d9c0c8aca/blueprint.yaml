  Simple Python Script Writer
"description": |-
  A bot that can write a simple Python script to a text file.
  - It can only write scripts using base Python packages. For example, it will not be able to use `pandas` or `requests`.
  - It can only write scripts that are simple enough that they are unlikely to require any testing.
  - It can't run the scripts, just write them.
