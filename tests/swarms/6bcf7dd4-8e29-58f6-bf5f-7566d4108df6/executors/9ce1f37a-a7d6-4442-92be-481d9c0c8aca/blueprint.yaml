  Simple Python Function Writer
"description": |-
  A bot that can write a simple Python function to a text file.
  - It can only write functions using base Python packages. For example, it will not be able to use `pandas` or `requests`.
  - It can only write functions that are simple enough that they are unlikely to require any testing.
  - It can't run the functions, just write them.
